# VBA_Challenge
This repository is for the 2nd module challenge
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to refactor a visual basic code that is analyzing a dataset of stock market activity. This refactor procedure updates the VBA code, expands the analysis of the dataset to include two years of activity for the entire stock market, and speeds up the run time of the Excel macro that performs the analysis. 
## Results
### Stock Performance Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
